These are the packages I installed to get sox "play" working:

sudo apt-get install sox
sudo apt-get install pulseaudio
sudo apt-get install lame
sudo apt-get install libsox-fmt-mp3

If you want to use the command line "cvlc" player:

sudo apt-get install vlc

If you want to run python vlc:

sudo pip install python-vlc

I've found vlc is fairly unstable in Raspbian, it tends to trip up and spawn
multiple players and doesn't exit gracefully. sox has been the better option.

Note:
You may need the lame encoder and/or pulseaudio for cvlc.
