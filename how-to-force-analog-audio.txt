# First try to use raspi-config to switch
sudo raspi-config
# Go to Advanced Options, Audio, then Force 3.5mm 

# This will reset volume to almost muted. Do not attempt to adjust using the
# gui, this will auto select the device back to HDMI. Instead use:
amixer sset 'Master' 100%

# If that doesn't work, or switches back to HDMI, try using amixer again.
# Set the default output (numid=3) to analog output (1). HDMI is 2. 
amixer cset numid=3 1

# You may have to set the volume again using amixer.
